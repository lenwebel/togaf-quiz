Question 1
Question Type: MultipleChoice
Scenario
You are working as an Enterprise Architect within an Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a large
government agency. The agency has multiple divisions.
The agency has a well-established EA practice and follows the TOGAF standard as its method for
architecture development. Along with the EA program, the agency also uses various
management frameworks, including business planning, project/portfolio management, and
operations management. The EA program is sponsored by the Chief Information Officer (CIO),
who has actively promoted architecting with agility within the EA department as her preferred
approach for projects.
The government has mandated that the agency prepare themselves for an Artificial Intelligence
(AI)-first world, which they have called their ''AI-first'' plan. As a result, the agency is looking to
determine the impact and role that AI will play moving forward. The CIO has approved a Request
for Architecture Work to look at how AI can be used for services across the agency. She has noted
that digital platforms will be a priority for investment in order to scale the AI applications
planned. Using AI to automate tasks and make things run smoother is seen as a big advantage.
Process automation and improved efficiency from manual, repetitive activities have been
identified as the key benefits of applying generative AI to their agency's business. This will
include back-office automation, for example, for help center agents who receive hundreds of
email inquiries. This should also improve services for citizens by making them more efficient and
personalized, tailored to each individual's needs.
Many of the agency leaders are worried about relying too much on AI. Some leaders think their
employees will need to learn new skills. Some employees are worried they might lose their jobs
to AI. Other leaders worry about security and cyber resilience in the digital platforms needed for
AI to be successful.
The leader of the Enterprise Architecture team has asked for your suggestions on how to address
the concerns, and how to manage the risks of a new architecture for the AI-first project.
Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?
Options:
A- You recommend creating an Organization Map to display the links between different parts of
the agency. This will help the EA team to find and involve all areas of the agency impacted by
this strategic change. Multiple business models should then be created that can be applied to AIrelated projects. A meeting will be held with the stakeholders to teach them how to interpret the
models and see how their concerns are being addressed. Risk will be managed as part of the
Free The Open Group OGEA-103 Exam Questions By Johnston - Page 3
Security Architecture development.
B- You recommend that the key stakeholders be formally identified. This should include those
who will be most helpful for the change to be successful. A Communication Plan should be made
to address their needs. This plan should include a report that summarizes the key features of the
architecture based on stakeholder requirements and addressing concerns. You communicate with
each key stakeholder to make sure their concerns are being addressed. You make sure that the
architecture being developed clearly addresses risk management.
C- You recommend conducting an analysis of the stakeholders. This involves documenting the
positions, concerns, issues, and cultural factors of each group. This information will shape how
the architecture is to be presented and communicated. The concerns and relevant views can
then be defined for each group and recorded in the Architecture Vision document. The
requirements for addressing risk should be recorded in the Architecture Requirements
Specification and checked through regular assessments and feedback.
D- You recommend conducting an analysis that separates the different types of stakeholders into
groups. They can be divided into categories: corporate functions, end-user organization, project
team, external vendors, and external partners. A model will be developed for each stakeholder
category to ensure that all the necessary information and actions are taken into account.
Meetings will be arranged with stakeholders to verify that their concerns have been adequately
addressed. Risk management will be included in this process.
Answer:
C
Explanation:

Question 2
Question Type: MultipleChoice
Scenario
Your role is that of an Enterprise Architect, reporting to the Chief Enterprise Architect, at a
technology company.
The company uses the TOGAF standard as the method and guiding framework for its Enterprise
Architecture (EA) practice. The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) is the sponsor of the activity. The
EA practice uses an iterative approach for its architecture development. This has enabled the
decision-makers to gain valuable insights into the different aspects of the business.
The nature of the business is such that the data and the information stored on the company
systems is the company's major asset and is highly confidential. The company employees travel
a lot for work and need to communicate over public infrastructure. They use message encryption,
secure internet connections using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and other standard security
measures. The company has provided computer security awareness training for all its staff.
However, despite good education and system security, there is still a need to rely on third-party
suppliers for infrastructure and software.
The Chief Security Officer (CSO) has noted an increase in ransomware (malicious software used in
ransom demands) attacks on companies with a similar profile. The CSO recognizes that no matter
how much is spent on education and support, the company could be a victim of a significant
attack that could completely lock them out of their important data.
A risk assessment has been completed, and the company has looked for cyber insurance that
covers ransomware. The price for this insurance is very high. The CTO recently saw a survey that
said 1 out of 4 businesses that paid ransoms could not get their data back, and almost the same
number were able to recover the data without paying. The CTO has decided not to get cyber
insurance to cover ransom payment.
You have been asked to describe the steps you would take to strengthen the current architecture
to improve data protection.
Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?
Options:
A- You would ensure that the company has in place up-to-date processes for managing change to
the current Enterprise Architecture. Based on the scope of the concerns raised, you recommend
Free The Open Group OGEA-103 Exam Questions By Johnston - Page 7
that this be managed at the infrastructure level. Changes should be made to the baseline
description of the Technology Architecture. The changes should be approved by the Architecture
Board and implemented by change management techniques.
B- You would request an Architecture Compliance Review with the scope to examine the
company's ability to respond to ransomware attacks. You would identify the departments
involved and have them nominate representatives. You would then tailor checklists to address
the requirement for increased resilience. You would circulate to the nominated representatives
for them to complete. You would then review the completed checklists, identifying and resolving
issues. You would then determine and present your recommendations.
C- You would monitor for technology updates from your existing suppliers that could enhance the
company's capabilities to detect, react, and recover from an IT security incident. You would
prepare and run a disaster recovery planning exercise for a ransomware attack and analyze the
performance of the current Enterprise Architecture. Using the findings, you would prepare a gap
analysis of the current Enterprise Architecture. You would prepare change requests to address
identified gaps. You would add the changes implemented to the Architecture Repository.
D- You would assess business continuity requirements and analyze the current Enterprise
Architecture for gaps. You would recommend changes to address the situation and create a
change request. You would engage the Architecture Board to assess and approve the change
request. Once approved, you would create a new Request for Architecture Work to begin an ADM
cycle to implement the changes.

evaluate the existing architecture and address specific resilience concerns.
Does not mention compliance review or tailored resilience measures for ransomware attacks,
which are central to the scenario.
Conclusion: Incorrect. It proposes a broader approach that may not adequately address the
immediate concerns highlighted by the CSO.
TOGAF Reference
Architecture Compliance Review: A structured process used to evaluate whether an architecture
meets the stated goals, objectives, and requirements (TOGAF 9.2, Chapter 19). It is particularly
useful for identifying and addressing resilience requirements in scenarios involving security risks.
Stakeholder Engagement: Identifying and involving stakeholders (e.g., departments) is a critical
part of architecture governance and compliance review (TOGAF 9.2, Section 24.2).
Change Management: The Architecture Compliance Review supports identifying necessary
changes, which are then managed through governance and change management processes
(TOGAF 9.2, Section 21.6).
By choosing Option B, you align with TOGAF's structured approach to compliance, resilience, and
addressing security concerns.

Question 3
Question Type: MultipleChoice
Scenario
You are working as an Enterprise Architect within an Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a global
company that sells consumer products. The company produces many products that buyers use
and enjoy.
The company has announced a major change to its products that will occur over a four-year
period. This change includes the introduction of digital products and services. An architecture to
support this strategy has been finished, along with a roadmap for a set of projects to implement
this significant change. This will be a cross-functional effort between the product design and
software teams. It is planned to be developed in phases.
The company faces a challenge in presenting and providing access to different services through
its products and digital platforms while ensuring compliance with data privacy laws. In some
countries and regions, the data residency requirements mean that the company has to store
certain data within the region where it is collected. As a result, the company's application
portfolio and infrastructure must connect with various cloud services and data repositories in
different countries.
The EA team has inherited the architecture used by the current products, some of which can be
carried over to the new products. The EA team has started to define which parts of the
architecture to carry forward. Enough of the Business Architecture has been defined so that work
can commence on the Information Systems and Technology Architectures. Those architectures
need to be defined to support the key digital services that the company plans to provide.
The company uses the TOGAF Standard as the foundation for its Enterprise Architecture
framework, and architecture development follows the purpose-based EA Capability model
outlined in the TOGAF Series Guide: A Practitioner's Approach to Developing Enterprise
Architecture Following the TOGAF ADM. The EA team reports to the Chief Information Officer
(CIO), who oversees the program.
You have been asked how to decide and organize the work to deliver the requested architectures.
Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?
Options:
A- You refer to the superior architecture for guidance. You review the projects identified, their
dependencies, and synergies, then decide the sequence for starting the projects. You develop
high-level architecture descriptions. For each project, you determine how much work is needed,
identify reference architectures, and candidate building blocks. You identify the resource needs
taking into account cost and value. You document the different options, risks, and ways to control
Free The Open Group OGEA-103 Exam Questions By Johnston - Page 11
them to enable feasibility analysis and trade-off with the stakeholders.
B- You look outside the company to study how other companies organize their data models and
application portfolios. You create just enough architecture description for the Application, Data,
and Technology Architectures to identify the different options. For each project, this includes
identification of candidate architecture and solution building blocks. You then identify solution
providers, perform a readiness assessment, and assess the viability and fitness of the solution
options. You then write the draft Implementation and Migration plan.
C- You research leading data companies, using your findings to help in developing high-level
Target Data, Application, and Technology Architectures. You review the Architecture Vision to
determine the level of detail, time, and scope of the ADM cycle phases required for each project.
You identify and estimate the cost of the main resources. You then prepare an Architecture
Roadmap and request the Architecture Board to review the roadmap. You then start the project.
D- You commence an iteration of ADM Phase A, identifying the stakeholders and revising the
Architecture Vision. You perform a Stakeholder Analysis and update the Stakeholder Map. You
conduct workshops and interviews to reflect the stakeholders who are now the key drivers for the
digital products and services. You coordinate with the CIO to ensure alignment with the overall
roadmap and update the Implementation and Migration Plan accordingly.

Question 4
Question Type: MultipleChoice
Scenario
You are working as an Enterprise Architect within a large manufacturing company. The company
has multiple divisions located worldwide.
After a recent study, senior management is concerned about the impact of the company's
multiple data centers and duplication of applications on business efficiency. To address this
concern, a strategic architecture has been defined; it will help improve the ability to meet
customer demand and improve the efficiency of operations. The strategic architecture involves
the consolidation of multiple application programs that are currently used in different divisions
Free The Open Group OGEA-103 Exam Questions By Johnston - Page 14
and putting them all onto a cloud-based solution instead.
Each division has completed the Architecture Definition documentation to meet its own specific
operational requirements. The enterprise architects have analyzed the corporate changes and
implementation constraints. A consolidated gap analysis has been completed. Based on its
results, the architects have reviewed the requirements, dependencies, and interoperability
requirements needed to integrate the cloud-based solution. The architects have completed the
Business Transformation Readiness Assessment. Based on all these factors, they have produced
a risk assessment. They have also completed the draft Implementation and Migration Plan, the
draft Architecture Roadmap, and the Capability Assessment deliverables.
Due to the risks of changing from the current environment, the decision has been taken that a
gradual approach is needed to implement the target architecture. It will likely take a few years to
complete the whole implementation process.
The company has a mature Enterprise Architecture (EA) practice and uses the TOGAF standard
for its architecture development method. The EA practice is engaged throughout all the divisions,
with implementation governance assigned to a business line. In addition to providing guidance on
using architecture frameworks, including business planning, project/portfolio management, and
operations management, the EA program is sponsored by the Chief Information Officer (CIO).
You have been asked to decide on the next steps for the migration planning.
Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?
Options:
A- You update the Architecture Definition Document, which includes setting project objectives
and documenting the final requirements. This will ensure that the architecture remains relevant
and responsive to the needs of the enterprise. You then produce an Implementation Governance
Model to manage the lessons learned prior to finalizing the Implementation and Migration Plan.
You recommend that lessons learned be applied as changes to the architecture without review.
B- You conduct a series of Compliance Assessments to ensure that the architecture is being
implemented according to the contract. The Compliance Assessment verifies that the
implementation team is using the proper development methodology. It should include
deployment of monitoring tools and ensure that performance targets are being met. If they are
not met, then you would identify changes to performance requirements and update those in the
Implementation and Migration Plan.
C- You examine how the Implementation and Migration Plan affects the other frameworks being
used in the organization. You coordinate the planning with the business planning,
project/portfolio management, and operations management frameworks. You assign a business
value to each project, considering the available resources and how well they align with the
strategy. You then update the architecture roadmap and the Implementation and Migration Plan.
D- You assess the business value for each project by applying the Business Value Assessment
Technique. The assessment should focus on return on investment and performance evaluation
Free The Open Group OGEA-103 Exam Questions By Johnston - Page 15
criteria to prioritize the most progress of the architecture transformation. You confirm and plan a
series of Transition Architecture phases using an Architecture Definition Increments Table. You
document the lessons learned and generate the final Implementation and Migration Plan.
Answer:
C
Explanation:
Context of the Scenario
The organization is currently in the Migration Planning phase, which corresponds to Phase F of
the TOGAF ADM (Architecture Development Method). The key activities for this phase involve:
Evaluating dependencies and impacts on other organizational frameworks.
Aligning the roadmap and migration plan with strategic objectives and available resources.
Addressing the risks of transitioning from the current architecture to the target architecture using
a phased approach.
The deliverables (Architecture Roadmap, Capability Assessment, etc.) and assessments (Gap
Analysis, Risk Assessment, Transformation Readiness) have already been developed. The next
step is to refine and finalize the migration planning.
Option Analysis
Option A:
While updating the Architecture Definition Document could ensure alignment, this step was
completed in earlier phases (B, C, D). At this stage, further changes to the architecture must go
through a formal governance review, and applying lessons learned without review contradicts
TOGAF principles.
Producing an Implementation Governance Model is more relevant in Phase G (Implementation
Governance), not in Phase F.
Conclusion: Incorrect, as it suggests revisiting earlier steps and does not align with the current
phase.
Option B:
Conducting Compliance Assessments ensures the architecture is implemented correctly, but this
is a task for Phase G (Implementation Governance) after migration planning has been finalized
and implementation begins.
Deployment of monitoring tools is also part of implementation and governance activities, not
migration planning.
Free The Open Group OGEA-103 Exam Questions By Johnston - Page 16
Conclusion: Incorrect, as it focuses on tasks belonging to a later phase.
Option C:
Examining how the Implementation and Migration Plan affects other organizational frameworks is
critical in Phase F, as TOGAF emphasizes alignment with business planning, project/portfolio
management, and operations management.
Assigning business value to each project ensures prioritization and optimal allocation of
resources.
Updating the Architecture Roadmap and the Implementation and Migration Plan based on this
analysis ensures strategic alignment and readiness for implementation.
Conclusion: Correct, as it addresses the key objectives of the Migration Planning phase
comprehensively.
Option D:
Applying the Business Value Assessment Technique is valid for prioritizing initiatives but is a
limited aspect of Migration Planning.
Planning Transition Architecture phases and documenting lessons learned are valid, but this does
not address broader organizational impacts or dependencies as effectively as Option C.
Conclusion: Narrow focus; less comprehensive than Option C.
Reference to TOGAF
Phase F (Migration Planning): The focus is on aligning the migration plan with business objectives,
considering organizational dependencies, and prioritizing projects (TOGAF 9.2, Chapter 12).
Architecture Roadmap and Implementation Plan: Updated to reflect changes in priorities and
alignment with business frameworks (TOGAF 9.2, Section 12.4).
Framework Integration: Collaboration with other frameworks (e.g., business planning, portfolio
management) ensures alignment across the organization (TOGAF 9.2, Section 6.5.2).
Business Value Assessment Technique: Used to prioritize initiatives based on return on
investment and performance criteria (TOGAF 9.2, Section 24.4).
Question 5
Question Type: MultipleChoice
Please read this scenario prior to answering the question
You are working as an Enterprise Architect within a healthcare and life science company. The
Free The Open Group OGEA-103 Exam Questions By Johnston - Page 17
company is a
leading player in its industry, dedicated to transforming healthcare with new ideas and
advancements. The
company has multiple divisions that cover different aspects of the business.
The company's Enterprise Architecture (EA) department has been operating for several years and
has
mature, well-developed architecture governance and development processes following the
TOGAF
Standard. In addition to the EA program, the company has a number of management frameworks
in use.
The Architecture Board includes representatives from each division of the company.
Many of the company's rivals have begun utilizing Artificial Intelligence (Al) in their operations,
and the
indications are that this will be transformative for healthcare delivery. This is something the EA
department
has been interested in for a while, and they had recently submitted an architecture Change
Request which
was approved. As a result, the CIO has approved a Request for Architecture Work to investigate
the
implementation of Al in the company.
Areas for evaluation include:
How can staff use Al daily in their current role?
How Al can enhance access to care for patients, and how to make that experience seamless?
How Al can offer new workplace platforms and tools to increase efficiency?
Some of the top managers are worried about a change in the way of working, and if it will achieve
the goals.
Many are not confident that the company's risk management processes are adequate for a
company-wide
integration of generative Al. There are also questions from staff about whether enough specific
guidelines
and polices have been put in place for responsible use of Al.
The Chief Information Officer (CIO) is the sponsor of the Enterprise Architecture program. The CIO
Free The Open Group OGEA-103 Exam Questions By Johnston - Page 18
has
actively encouraged architecting with agility within the EA department as her preferred approach
for projects.
The CIO wants to know how to address these concerns and reduce risks.
Refer to the scenario
You have been tasked with starting the architecture development. How do you begin?
Based on the TOGAF standard which of the following is the best answer?
Options:
A- You recommend that an analysis of the stakeholders is undertaken. This will allow the
architects to
define groups of partners (the stakeholders) who have common concerns and include
development
of a Stakeholder Map. The concerns and relevant views should then be defined for each group
and
recorded in the Architecture Vision document. To mitigate risk, you include a requirement that
there
be progressive development of the target architecture to ensure there is regular feedback.
B- You recommend that a Communications Plan be created to address the key stakeholders, that
is the
most powerful and influential partners. This plan should include a report that summarizes the key
features of the architecture with respect to each location and reflects the stakeholders'
requirements.
You will check with each key stakeholder that their concerns are being addressed. Risk mitigation
should be explicitly addressed as a component of the architecture being developed.
C- You recommend that models be created for the Draft Business, Data, Application, and
Technology
Architectures. These can be used to ensure that the system will be compliant with the local
regulations for each division. Together with the problem description, and requirements, this
ensures
that all the necessary data and detail is addressed. A formal review should be held with the
stakeholders to verify that their concerns have been properly addressed by the models.
D- You recommend creation of a set of business models that can be applied uniformly across all
Alrelated architecture projects. These should be developed in the portable format to ensure
maximum
portability across the many tools used in the firm. Each architecture should then be defined
based on
this fixed set of models. All concerned parties can then examine the models to ensure that their
Free The Open Group OGEA-103 Exam Questions By Johnston - Page 19
needs have been addressed.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the enterprise is undergoing significant transformation due to a merger and the
adoption of new technology (hand-held devices). Several key principles from TOGAF's ADM
Techniques---particularly those focused on promoting enterprise-wide standardization,
adaptability, and data utilization---are pertinent here:
Maximize Benefit to the Enterprise: This principle emphasizes that all architectural decisions
should deliver maximum business value. Given that the company is integrating systems to cut
costs and improve offerings, maximizing the benefit is crucial. Ensuring that the EA efforts align
with enterprise-wide benefits supports the goal of optimizing costs and enhancing offerings,
which aligns with the CEO's vision for the merger.
Common Use Applications: Standardizing applications across the merged entity will be essential
to achieve cost savings and to simplify operations. The goal of reducing the number of
applications fits with this principle, ensuring that reusable and widely adopted applications
support business functions across the organization. Adopting this principle will also aid in
harmonizing the systems from both organizations and avoiding unnecessary diversity.
Data is an Asset: Data plays a central role in the company's operations, especially with the use of
AI-driven inventory management and the integration of systems. Treating data as an asset is
essential for reliable and accurate decision-making. This principle ensures that data is viewed as
a critical enterprise resource and is managed with care, maintaining integrity, accuracy, and
value.
Responsive Change Management: The organization's ability to adapt quickly and effectively to
changes, such as integrating new handheld devices and merging systems, is essential. This
principle will facilitate the smooth transition required for integrating the new handheld devices
and the merger-related system updates while minimizing disruption to store operations.
Technology Independence: Since the enterprise will likely encounter varied technologies from the
Free The Open Group OGEA-103 Exam Questions By Johnston - Page 32
merger, it is crucial to maintain flexibility. This principle advocates for using technology solutions
that are adaptable and not bound to a single vendor or specific technology. This ensures that the
enterprise can integrate various technological components from both organizations and evolve
with minimal constraints.
These principles align well with TOGAF's broader recommendations for guiding architectural
changes, as found in Section 2.6 of the TOGAF ADM Techniques. They ensure that the EA practice
is aligned with business objectives while maintaining flexibility, data integrity, and a focus on
enterprise-wide benefits. These guiding principles are critical for the successful execution of the
integration and adoption of new technologies while achieving cost efficiencies and improving
service delivery.
For reference, TOGAF's ADM Techniques highlight the importance of architectural principles in
guiding transformational initiatives, ensuring that decisions are made consistently across the
enterprise. Each principle supports organizational agility, system integration, and the efficient
use of technology resources, all of which are vital for the enterprise's stated objectives.
