However, despite good education and system security, there is still a need to rely on third-party suppliers for infrastructure and software. The Chief Security Officer (CSO) has noted an increase in ransomware (malicious software used in ransom demands) attacks on companies with a similar profile. The CSO recognizes that no matter how much is spent on education and support, the company could be a victim of a significant attack that could completely lock them out of their important data. A risk assessment has been completed, and the company has looked for cyber insurance that covers ransomware. The price for this insurance is very high. The CTO recently saw a survey that said 1 out of 4 businesses that paid ransoms could not get their data back, and almost the same number were able to recover the data without paying. The CTO has decided not to get cyber insurance to cover ransom payment. You have been asked to describe the steps you would take to strengthen the current architecture to improve data protection. Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?",

        "You would ensure that the company has in place up-to-date processes for managing change to the current Enterprise Architecture. Based on the scope of the concerns raised, you recommend that this be managed at the infrastructure level. Changes should be made to the baseline description of the Technology Architecture. The changes should be approved by the Architecture Board and implemented by change management techniques.",
        "You would request an Architecture Compliance Review with the scope to examine the company's ability to respond to ransomware attacks. You would identify the departments involved and have them nominate representatives. You would then tailor checklists to address the requirement for increased resilience. You would circulate to the nominated representatives for them to complete. You would then review the completed checklists, identifying and resolving issues. You would then determine and present your recommendations.",
        "You would monitor for technology updates from your existing suppliers that could enhance the company's capabilities to detect, react, and recover from an IT security incident. You would prepare and run a disaster recovery planning exercise for a ransomware attack and analyze the performance of the current Enterprise Architecture. Using the findings, you would prepare a gap analysis of the current Enterprise Architecture. You would prepare change requests to address identified gaps. You would add the changes implemented to the Architecture Repository.",
        "You would assess business continuity requirements and analyze the current Enterprise Architecture for gaps. You would recommend changes to address the situation and create a change request.

      "question": "Scenario: You are working as an Enterprise Architect within an Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a global company that sells consumer products. The company produces many products that buyers use and enjoy. The company has announced a major change to its products that will occur over a four-year period. This change includes the introduction of digital products and services. An architecture to support this strategy has been finished, along with a roadmap for a set of projects to implement this significant change. This will be a cross-functional effort between the product design and software teams. It is planned to be developed in phases. The company faces a challenge in presenting and providing access to different services through its products and digital platforms while ensuring compliance with data privacy laws. In some countries and regions, the data residency requirements mean that the company has to store certain data within the region where it is collected. As a result, the company's application portfolio and infrastructure must connect with various cloud services and data repositories in different countries. The EA team has inherited the architecture used by the current products, some of which can be carried over to the new products. The EA team has started to define which parts of the architecture to carry forward. Enough of the Business Architecture has been defined so that work can commence on the Information Systems and Technology Architectures. Those architectures need to be defined to support the key digital services that the company plans to provide. The company uses the TOGAF Standard as the foundation for its Enterprise Architecture framework, and architecture development follows the purpose-based EA Capability model outlined in the TOGAF Series Guide: A Practitioner's Approach to Developing Enterprise Architecture Following the TOGAF ADM. The EA team reports to the Chief Information Officer (CIO), who oversees the program. You have been asked how to decide and organize the work to deliver the requested architectures. Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?",
      "options": [
        "You refer to the superior architecture for guidance. You review the projects identified, their dependencies, and synergies, then decide the sequence for starting the projects. You develop high-level architecture descriptions. For each project, you determine how much work is needed, identify reference architectures, and candidate building blocks. You identify the resource needs taking into account cost and value. You document the different options, risks, and ways to control them to enable feasibility analysis and trade-off with the stakeholders.",
        "You look outside the company to study how other companies organize their data models and application portfolios. You create just enough architecture description for the Application, Data, and Technology Architectures to identify the different options. For each project, this includes identification of candidate architecture and solution building blocks. You then identify solution providers, perform a readiness assessment, and assess the viability and fitness of the solution options. You then write the draft Implementation and Migration plan.",
        "You research leading data companies, using your findings to help in developing high-level Target Data, Application, and Technology Architectures. You review the Architecture Vision to determine the level of detail, time, and scope of the ADM cycle phases required for each project. You identify and estimate the cost of the main resources. You then prepare an Architecture Roadmap and request the Architecture Board to review the roadmap. You then start the project.",
        "You commence an iteration of ADM Phase A, identifying the stakeholders and revising the Architecture Vision. You perform a Stakeholder Analysis and update the Stakeholder Map. You conduct workshops and interviews to reflect the stakeholders who are now the key drivers for the digital products and services. You coordinate with the CIO to ensure alignment with the overall roadmap and update the Implementation and Migration Plan accordingly."

      "question": "Scenario: You are working as an Enterprise Architect within an Enterprise Architecture (EA) team at a large government agency. The agency has multiple divisions. The agency has a well-established EA practice and follows the TOGAF standard as its method for architecture development. Along with the EA program, the agency also uses various management frameworks, including business planning, project/portfolio management, and operations management. The EA program is sponsored by the Chief Information Officer (CIO), who has actively promoted architecting with agility within the EA department as her preferred approach for projects. The government has mandated that the agency prepare themselves for an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-first world, which they have called their ''AI-first'' plan. As a result, the agency is looking to determine the impact and role that AI will play moving forward. The CIO has approved a Request for Architecture Work to look at how AI can be used for services across the agency. She has noted that digital platforms will be a priority for investment in order to scale the AI applications planned. Using AI to automate tasks and make things run smoother is seen as a big advantage. Process automation and improved efficiency from manual, repetitive activities have been identified as the key benefits of applying generative AI to their agency's business. This will include back-office automation, for example, for help center agents who receive hundreds of email inquiries. This should also improve services for citizens by making them more efficient and personalized, tailored to each individual's needs. Many of the agency leaders are worried about relying too much on AI. Some leaders think their employees will need to learn new skills. Some employees are worried they might lose their jobs to AI. Other leaders worry about security and cyber resilience in the digital platforms needed for AI to be successful. The leader of the Enterprise Architecture team has asked for your suggestions on how to address the concerns, and how to manage the risks of a new architecture for the AI-first project. Based on the TOGAF standard, which of the following is the best answer?",
      "options": [
        "You recommend creating an Organization Map to display the links between different parts of the agency. This will help the EA team to find and involve all areas of the agency impacted by this strategic change. Multiple business models should then be created that can be applied to AI-related projects. A meeting will be held with the stakeholders to teach them how to interpret the models and see how their concerns are being addressed. Risk will be managed as part of the Security Architecture development.",
        "You recommend that the key stakeholders be formally identified. This should include those who will be most helpful for the change to be successful. A Communication Plan should be made to address their needs. This plan should include a report that summarizes the key features of the architecture based on stakeholder requirements and addressing concerns. You communicate with each key stakeholder to make sure their concerns are being addressed. You make sure that the architecture being developed clearly addresses risk management.",
        "You recommend conducting an analysis of the stakeholders. This involves documenting the positions, concerns, issues, and cultural factors of each group. This information will shape how the architecture is to be presented and communicated. The concerns and relevant views can then be defined for each group and recorded in the Architecture Vision document. The requirements for addressing risk should be recorded in the Architecture Requirements Specification and checked through regular assessments and feedback.",
        "You recommend conducting an analysis that separates the different types of stakeholders into groups. They can be divided into categories: corporate functions, end-user organization, project team, external vendors, and external partners. A model will be developed for each stakeholder category to ensure that all the necessary information and actions are taken into account. Meetings will be arranged with stakeholders to verify that their concerns have been adequately addressed. Risk management will be included in this process."
